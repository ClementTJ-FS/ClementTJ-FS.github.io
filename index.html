       <p id="info">
        Ferrari S.p.A. (<em>fəˈrɑːri</em>; Italian: <b>ferˈraːri</b>) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of the Alfa Romeo race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first Ferrari-badged car in 1947.<br><br>
        Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.  In October 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari. The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari S.p.A. group, and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016.<br><br>
        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors championships (16) and having produced the highest number of drivers' championship wins (15) Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth Ferrari cars are built at the 165,000 square-meter (16.5-hectare) Maranello factory In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance In June 2018, a 1963 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million.

       <h2>Cars</h2>

       <h3>Ferrari 250 GT California</h3>
       <img src="img/250gt.jpg" alt="Ferrari 250 GT California" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The Ferrari 250GT California was the go to car for the wealthy elite looking to feel the wind and enjoy the sunshine while driving downtown. It had great looks and commanded tremendous respect from onlookers. It was powered by a V12 engine that could achieve 280hp and could perform excellently on the track without compromising on comfort. It is still one of the most attractive cars in the world that is greatly sought after by collectors.

       <h3>Ferrari 250 TR</h3>
       <img src="img/250tr.jpg" alt="Ferrari 250 TR" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The 250 TestaRossa was based on the 250 line that won several races, including the 1956, 1960, and 1961 Le Mans. The road model was handcrafted by Scaglietti, the best coach builder in Ferrari, and is evident in the delicate design of the front fenders separated from the bonnet. As a result, the car has a Formula One appearance, but the one in which wealthy people drive to and from work. Today, it is still one of the most desirable Ferrari of all time after it was sold at a 2011 auction for $16.4 million.

       <h3>Ferrari 250 GTO</h3>
       <img src="img/250gto.jpg" alt="Ferrari 250 GTO" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        Most people who have been following the Ferrari lineup to date are probably familiar with the Ferrari 250 GTO. Only thirty nine samples were produced from ’62 to ’64, making it one of the hardest Ferraris to find on the planet. The performance is excellent too, as the car has won three FIFA World Championships in a row. Apart from performance, the car features a beautiful design, which was done at Pininfarina under Scaglietti’s leadership. One 250 GTO was said to cost $31 million US in a private auction.

       <h3>Ferrari 275 GTB</h3>
       <img src="img/275.jpg" alt="Ferrari 275 GTB" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The 275 GTB was basically an upgrade of the Berlinetta series of Ferrari GT, designed by Pininfarina. It was handcrafted by Scaglietti and bred a new series of super cars that gained the popularity of Ferrari enthusiasts, until today. The design is conspicuously responsible for the Berlinettas we see today.
       </p><br><br>

       <h3>Ferrari 288 GTO</h3>
       <img src="img/288.jpg" alt="Ferrari 288 GTO" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The 288 GTO came 22 years after the first GTO model was released: the 250 GTO. While the GTO models tend to be underpowered these days, they commanded a lot of attention during their time. The 288 GTO introduced the production and development of parts designed from composite materials, leading to a stronger chassis while maintaining a low weight. As a result, the performance was impeccable, with the car looking and performing better than it was actually worth.
       </p><br><br>

       <h3>Ferrari F40</h3>
       <img src="img/f40.jpg" alt="Ferrari F40" class="carI"/>      
       <p class="carP">
        The last car developed under the Enzo Ferrari leadership, the F40 is still one of the most sought after super cars. The car was built as a last wish from Enzo Ferrari, who wanted to create the best car on the planet. To some extent, his wishes came true. The car was drew inspiration from the 288GTO, which featured great power and jaw-dropping speeds. The main aspect of the design was a tall spoiler that, although not suitable for the sleek appearance of the car, had to be incorporated to prevent the Ferrari from turning skyward as it cruised at a top speed of 196mph.

       <h3>Ferrari Enzo</h3>
       <img src="img/enzo.jpg" alt="Ferrari Enzo" class="carI"/>      
       <p class="carP">
        Bearing the same name as the founder, the 2002 Enzo was one of the most iconic Ferraris of all time in terms of stance. The car boasted modern F1 technology, from the paddle shift transmission to the carbon fiber body to the Carbon-ceramic composite disc brakes. The car also came with stimulating aerodynamics, which manually activated the back wing for down-force at a staggering speed of 186mph (300km/h). The Enzo had a sensational design. The nose was inspired by the traditional F1 design, featuring gullwing doors that left boys and men alike drooling over it. The car has maintained its remarkable speed and is still sought after today.

       <h3>Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano</h3>
       <img src="img/599.jpg" alt="Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The design in the 599 GTP was exceptional and the power could easily put most of its competitors to shame at the time. The car was launched i 2006 at the Geneva Motor Show and was received positively from the press and audience alike. The stretched bonnet pays homage to the 1967 Daytona while the muscular curves made the car immediately recognizable. It relied on a 6-L V12 engine from Enzo, making it the most powerful production car during its time. These features helped it achieve 620hp.
       </p><br><br>
      
       <h3>Ferrari 458 Italia</h3>
       <img src="img/458.jpg" alt="Ferrari 458 Italia" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        This is one of the rarest cars in the world that achieves a delicate balance between precisely engineered aerodynamics and soulful design. The idea was to create a beautiful car that was lighter and more aerodynamic than the previous Ferarri F430, which did not receive a very desirable welcome. The design was somewhat reminiscent of the Ferarri Enzo, one of the most iconic super-cars in the industry, while the engine was a strong 4.5-L V8 engine.
       </p><br><br>

       <h3>Ferrari F12 Berlinetta</h3>
       <img src="img/f12.jpg" alt="Ferrari F12 Berlinetta" class="carI"/>
       <p class="carP">
        The Berlinetta replaced the diminishing 599 GTB, and came with a design that was highly reminiscent of the previous 275 and 250 GT models. The car also combines elegant style with accurate aerodynamic proportions, as is evident in the carefully crafted vents and scoops that channel air out while creating significant down force. The car looks like it’s moving even when parked, and brags the fastest speed in a production car from Ferrari after the 599 GTO. In addition to the boisterous specs hidden below the gorgeous body, the car could be driven for long distances with restrained power and exceptional comfort.
